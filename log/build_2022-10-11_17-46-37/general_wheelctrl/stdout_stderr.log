[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrogilink2_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rogilink2_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "rogilink2_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    rogilink2_interfacesConfig.cmake
    rogilink2_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rogilink2_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "rogilink2_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "rogilink2_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
